This ia a c++ library about math.
Now it has only component of native number.
To install this library:

'make install'

I only test this library in linux.


To use this library:

#include <native_number>

and declare a variable:
native_number n;

The library has supplied +,-,*,/,%.
So you could use native_number variable just as before.
Such as:
n + 23
n += 38293
n = n * 100
n *= 10000
